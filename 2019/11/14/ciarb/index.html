  <meta name="description" content="This letter is to be sent to Mr Halket tomorrow. (I have edited the text below to reflect what I sent to Mr Halket.) Thomas D. Halket President The Chartered Institute of Arbitrators 12 Bloomsbury Square London WC1A 2LP Dear Sir, I recently found myself outside your august organisation’s building in Bloomsbury Square, chanting with Hongkongers in support of their fight for justice. Your website informs us that Secretary Teresa Cheng, whilst entering the building was assaulted by a crowd. As a result she sustained an injury to her arm. CIArb is committed to peacefully resolving conflict and deplores the use of violence, particularly to a guest to the United Kingdom. It is not evident, at least to me, from the substantial quantity of video footage of the incident that has emerged that Cheng was at any point “assaulted”; certainly the vast majority of the crowd were merely heckling and following—no different from a mêlée of journalists. Cheng may claim to have been assaulted, but there is no particular reason to trust her. It is incumbent upon any party making such imputations, both legally and morally, to provide evidence. No evidence, even from eyewitnesses, has been furnished in support of this claim. If there is no evidence for this claim, it is then incumbent on you to retract what would be evidentially indistinct from a false claim. No mention is made of the remainder of the protest activity. CIArb may “deplore” alleged violence. Does it deplore the message we attempted to convey to those coming to attend the lecture and passers-by this evening? Why must CIArb choose someone who not only reinforces tyranny, as we explained, but also has a highly questionable personal life? How can CIArb claim to be a credible institution when it considers appropriate an invitation to someone who remained in office as Secretary of Justice whilst decisions were made concerning prosecutions relating to illegal construction at her husband’s property? The corrupt do not turn out to simply be perfectly respectable people after all simply because they live in the East: I am sure that CIArb would never invite a British minister who had done similar things.1 How exactly can CIArb claim to be “committed to peacefully resolving conflict” when it invites a government official who plays a crucial rôle in the violent suppression of dissent? In recent months the police have fired so much tear gas that more than 88% of the population have been exposed to it.2 Tear gas has entered elderly homes,3 hit a first aider,4 and been fired in an underground train station.5 The police have also fired sub-lethal bullets at journalists,6 ignored a gang attack for forty minutes despite rushing to arrest protesters everywhere else,7 sexually harassed detainees,8 and even locked up the uninvolved.9 Those who object to this creeping tyranny are threatened with ten year sentences for ‘rioting’ by Cheng’s department. At this point it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that CIArb either have not done very much research on Cheng or have decided that “peaceful resolution” of conflict may involve beatings, tear gas, and shootings, so long as the victims are of Asian extraction. The foundation of arbitration must be the rule of law. But prosecutors from her own department have complained of her ‘kowtowing’10 and an unprecedented number of silent marches by lawyers has taken place in recent months due to a pattern of political prosecutions.11 Even if one rejects the claims of the protest movement, it is frankly astonishing that CIArb considers Cheng to be someone qualified to speak on arbitration. Everyone in Hong Kong, regardless of their political views, acknowledges the escalation of violence—they simply disagree about who is to blame, who is being more violent, and what should be done. Quite how it is possible to then come to the conclusion that a senior official of such a government should be invited to speak about a process by which disputes are supposed to be resolved or mitigated, not exacerbated and elongated, eludes me, and I am sure many others.

<p>I recently found myself outside your august organisation’s building in Bloomsbury Square, chanting with Hongkongers in support of their fight for justice. Your website informs us that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Secretary Teresa Cheng, whilst entering the building was assaulted by a crowd. As a result she sustained an injury to her arm.</p>

<blockquote>

Cheng may claim to have been assaulted, but there is no particular reason to trust her. It is incumbent upon any party making such imputations, both legally and morally, to provide evidence.
