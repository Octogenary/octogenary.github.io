  <title>Alex Chow Tsz-lok</title>
  <meta name="description" content="This morning, I awoke to read that Alex Chow Tsz-lok died.1 The South China Morning Post says that: at 12:20 Chow entered the car park alone, around the same time protesters were building road blocks, at 12:41 teargas was fired nearby, it is suspected that at about 12:45 Chow fell, at 12:46 about a dozen people run across the second floor of the car park, though it is not obvious whether Chow was one of them, at 12:55 firefighters arrived at the second floor of the car park, from 12:56 to 1:00 passers-by assemble at the scene, riot police enter the car park at about 1:04, two firefighters on seeing Chow immediately provide first aid, whilst police enter the car park to disperse people allegedly throwing projectiles at them from the car park, at 1:11 an ambulance was called by firefighters, and, at the same time, or so a first-aider alleges, the police threatened them with guns—police say instead that they used “guns”2 and batons on protesters in the car park, and an ambulance was blocked by a variety of vehicles,3 at 1:15 about 20 riot policemen appear near where Chow fell but leave after a minute, at 1:20 another ambulance was blocked by private vehicles, and three paramedics set off on foot, whilst a medic in the ambulance says that the police are blocking them, at 1:26 those in the ambulance repeat that they cannot reach the car park, at 1:30 the paramedics walking on foot arrive, and finally at 1:41 the ambulance finally arrived and took Chow to Queen Elizabeth Hospital. Is the case suspicious? I think that these are the five most relevant questions: Did the police attack Chow in the car park directly? Did the police behave in a reckless fashion in firing teargas nearby, and, in so doing, create a dangerous situation for those in the car park? Did the police directly obstruct the ambulance, paramedics, and so on? Did the police knowingly continue to behave in a way that they would impede the rescue operation? Was anything else suspicious? I think not: once the ambulance arrived nothing seems to have been untoward. I also have seen no claims that Chow was somehow ensnared prior to entering the car park, though such concerns may be harder to rule out. Did the police attack Chow in the car park directly? I have not seen anyone suggest this so far, but it is possible that one might conclude this. Chow’s injuries do not appear to be consistent with being attacked in some fashion beforehand. There is no video indicating that Chow was directly attacked by police. This possibility cannot be ruled out. Did the police behave in a reckless fashion in firing teargas nearby, and, in so doing, create a dangerous situation for those in the car park? The Citizens Press Conference write: the police’s murderous dispersion tactics were the root of the accident. I have not yet seen definitive evidence either way that Chow fled because of tear gas. However, we do know that tear gas was fired near the car park, and that Chow was inside. Did the police directly obstruct the ambulance, paramedics, and so on? The SCMP article says that a medic alleges that the police pointed their guns at them. This is very concerning, but I do not believe that this inhibited care substantially. However, it may have disturbed paramedics sufficiently to cause Chan’s death. However, if these allegations are true, they are another example of damnable behaviour by the police. The police deny these allegations. I do not think that we should believe them. The mosque water cannon incident shows that the police clearly care more about their reputation than the truth.4 Did the police knowingly continue to behave in a way that would inhibit the rescue operation? Arguably, yes. Some sources on Telegram say that residents shouted at police that they should stop firing tear gas to allow traffic to flow, so as to permit the ambulance to reach the scene. The Prince Edward incident suggests that this is plausible. That is what I have concluded so far about the incident. A city on a rock? When I woke up and read of Chow’s death, I nearly cried. This, I think, is strange. I do not cry when I read Chris Wickham on the subjugation on the early mediæval peasant. I do not cry when I read in the New Left Review of the inefficacy of land reform in Tanzania. And to take a modern example, I do not cry when I see videos of Chilean or Iraqi or Lebanese police and soldiers attacking those whom they are supposed to protect. I think that Hong Kong was a sort of city on a Lion rock in my imagination. I always thought of it as a nearly democratic place filled with amusing bureaucrats—Disneyland with the Death Penalty but without the death penalty. Then Occupy Central came, and this image was shaken for a moment—but the police who thrashed Ken Tsang were jailed, and Disneyland with the Death Penalty without the death penalty restored itself in my mind. Then June came. And at first I was filled with hope: nearly a third of the population were marching, there was a realisation of the need to convince Mainlanders of the cause, many came out in support of an independent commission of inquiry. Then the violence started: violence because of government intransigence, violence because of police brutality, and violence because of moral and strategic failings—though I hate to say it. The Hong Kong that I knew—nothing like the real Hong Kong that the masses knew of high property prices, entrenched social division, and racism in the case of migrant workers—became an impossible as opposed to an incorrect illusion. But Hong Kong was in some sense a city on a rock. Hongkongers do not like to hear it, but in some sense they are keeping alive that Chinese tradition of fighting for right in the face of perhaps insurmountable odds. As I fear the movement is slowly petering out, whilst becoming yet more violent, I wonder whether it will manage to survive. Why do I care? I cannot even speak Putonghua; I have learnt a few Cantonese words because of the protests. I do not think that I perceptibly suffer from racism. It cannot be because of general moral concern: I do not find myself as affected by what is happening in Chile. I think it is because I still think of myself as “hua ren”, even as I am clearly not “zhong guo ren”: because the world still reminds me that I am Chinese, and I do not want to be thus reminded that the condition of my people is to be permanently at war, subjugated, hungry and cold. There are two ways out: for the world to cease to remind me that I am “hua ren”, and for such reminders to become a source of pride. Both require the same thing: the liberation of the Chinese people in the centre of their life—the Mainland. This diary entry is unlikely to be particularly rigorous as a diagnosis of my emotional condition, but I feel that I should try. The latter section is not likely to be of interest to anyone else, but it will hopefully serve as a permanent record for my own purposes.↩︎ I take these to be guns that fire rubber bullets.↩︎ I take it that these were simply stuck in traffic and not part of a deliberate attempt to kill Chow; if anyone were to want to kill him in HK’s current environment they would use more direct methods.↩︎ J.

    <p>This morning, I awoke to read that Alex Chow Tsz-lok died.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>The <em>South China Morning Post</em> says that:</p>
<ul>
<li>at 12:20 Chow entered the car park alone,</li>
<li>around the same time protesters were building road blocks,</li>
<li>at 12:41 teargas was fired nearby,</li>
<li>it is suspected that at about 12:45 Chow fell,</li>
<li>at 12:46 about a dozen people run across the second floor of the car park, though it is not obvious whether Chow was one of them,</li>
<li>at 12:55 firefighters arrived at the second floor of the car park,</li>
<li>from 12:56 to 1:00 passers-by assemble at the scene,</li>
<li>riot police enter the car park at about 1:04,</li>
<li>two firefighters on seeing Chow immediately provide first aid, whilst police enter the car park to disperse people allegedly throwing projectiles at them from the car park,</li>
<li>at 1:11 an ambulance was called by firefighters, and, at the same time, or so a first-aider alleges, the police threatened them with guns—police say instead that they used “guns”<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> and batons on protesters in the car park, and an ambulance was blocked by a variety of vehicles,<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></li>
<li>at 1:15 about 20 riot policemen appear near where Chow fell but leave after a minute,</li>
<li>at 1:20 another ambulance was blocked by private vehicles, and three paramedics set off on foot, whilst a medic in the ambulance says that the police are blocking them,</li>
<li>at 1:26 those in the ambulance repeat that they cannot reach the car park,</li>
<li>at 1:30 the paramedics walking on foot arrive,</li>
<li>and finally at 1:41 the ambulance finally arrived and took Chow to Queen Elizabeth Hospital.</li>
</ul>
<p>Is the case suspicious? I think that these are the five most relevant questions:</p>
