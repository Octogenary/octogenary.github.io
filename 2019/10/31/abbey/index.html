  <meta name="description" content="There is much else I should like to say, especially about treatment of Mainland people. The Chaplain has been very helpful. I have had to cut some things, and what I am left with is as follows: The first line of “March of the Volunteers”, the Chinese national anthem, reads “Arise, ye who refuse to be slaves!” But in recent years at Westminster, democratic political views and values have come to be perceived as somehow opposed to Chinese ethnic identity. How has this happened? By one side, China is seen as a despotic régime, descended from that of Chairman Mao. It sees tens of millions of deaths and the myriad of atrocities that collectively overwhelm the human imagination: being forced to kill one’s parents, starvation, and the many tortures invented by millions of human minds bent to the most inhuman of purposes. Today it sees a fundamental unfairness, from concentration camps for Muslims to a lack of recourse when homes are demolished and lungs are poisoned by thoughtless development. Closer to home there are worries that opening a school in China could open us to pressure to curtail the freedom of expression we hold so dear at Westminster. Recent news from Blizzard, the National Basketball Association, and Apple is not encouraging. The other side? Here is a thought experiment. Suppose that a hundred of us were sent to a school in India. How would we feel if out of the blue we were asked: “Were your grandparents there at the Amritsar massacre?” “Why do you support the British government when it sells bombs to Saudi Arabia for killing families in Yemen?” “Did you support torture in Britain’s colonial war on the Mau Mau in Kenya?” “Look at the treatment of the Windrush generation. Are all Brits racist?” “What about your betrayal of the people of Diego Garcia?” “Why don’t you realise you are indoctrinated?” In sum, this sort of discourse reduces people to nations, and nations to the worst aspects of their governments. I would make two observations. First, there is a clear distinction between sensible political discussion about China and Sinophobia. Often, to replace “Chinese government” with “the Chinese” is enough to go from something that could be said in a calm conversation to nonsense about ‘a clash of civilisations’. We can all try to find common premises. In moral questions, we can perhaps all agree that ultimately we should strive for fairness, freedom from want, and even human rights. And when discussing how to achieve these aims, we can all recognise the human frailty and selfishness of ruling classes, whether politicians or businessmen, and everyone’s fallibility. Genuine political discussion isn’t a game, your interlocutor is not the Chinese government, and a cheap rhetorical victory doesn’t free Tibet. Second, to simply avoid difficult issues is a false economy. A common narrative assigns deference and discipline to China, and open debate to the West. But the history of China is one of peasant revolts just as indicative of a desire for freedom as anything in the history of the West. And it was because of patriotism and the desire for freedom that we resisted the forces of Imperial Japan in 1937. Were we wrong to refuse to bow down? So we should discuss the many difficulties of modern China. To do so without acrimony is entirely possible. It is a very Chinese tradition. And it clearly does not need to involve Sinophobia. We must not make excuses for ourselves. Westminster is a bubble. Regrettably, most are shut out. But in its protective embrace, let us try to have some of the discussions that the world needs but too often doesn’t want to have.">
