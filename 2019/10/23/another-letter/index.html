  <title>On finding another letter published</title>
  <meta name="description" content="I recently wrote a letter about an attack by the police with a water cannon on people outside Kowloon Mosque. In searching for it on the SCMP’s website I found another letter of mine.1 Alex Lo (“Protesters see the police as an occupation force”, September 1) suggests that the reason protesters are angered by the actions of the police, even though many Western police forces are more violent, is that they are viewed as an occupation force. There are two problems with this claim. First, the police have in some instances gone beyond international norms: they have beaten commuters on trains, collaborated with or at least turned a blind eye to triad violence against even those who were not involved in the protests, and routinely fired tear gas in dense residential areas. The police claimed that some protesters had changed clothes, as if that would justify thrashing people who were most likely uninvolved passengers. This would not be normal in most European states. Second, Hongkongers rightly expect higher standards than those in the West. That is because Hong Kong has surpassed the West in many respects. Would Lo wonder why there are complaints about MTR delays that would seem normal in London? Of course he wouldn’t, and that is why it is so ludicrous to think that Hongkongers’ higher expectations need an explanation. Perhaps many Europeans are resigned to the wanton excesses of their police; Hong Kong people aren’t yet. Lo also wonders why many seem to tolerate violence. I suggest he ask the chief executive. After all, the extradition amendment bill was suspended only after an unlawful assembly on June 12, when a peaceful march by a million people on June 9 had no such impact. I hope this serves to address the common argument online that the Hong Kong police are merely copying their Western counterparts and so should not be criticised.
