  <title>Diary: some old entries on Hong Kong</title>
  <meta name="description" content="13 June On Sunday, a million marched in Hong Kong against a bill that would permit extradition, to, inter alia, mainland China. The usual suspects of course appeared: pan-Democratic veterans, independence supporters, and students; but as the international press do not tire of noting, businesses, former officials, and even religious groups find themselves concerned by the bill. The risk is to Hong Kong qua Hong Kong, i.e., the only free Chinese city outside Taiwan on earth, and the legal innovation that Hong Kong’s common law represents. Sunday also saw perhaps thousands marching in overseas; in London, about 4,000 appeared at a protest organised by a group called “Democracy for Hong Kong” (D4HK). On Thursday, it delivered a letter to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, urging the British government to discharge its moral and legal duties to the people of Hong Kong. The principal demands made were further statements against the bill, a clear condemnation of police violence in the week after Sunday, a coalition with other governments to oppose the bill, a declaration of a breach of the Sino-British Joint Declaration in the event that the bill is passed, the inclusion of civil liberties in any trade deal with China, and action to protect the rights of holders of British National (Overseas) passports in Hong Kong. Those attending the protest were largely Cantonese-speaking Hong Kong people; some appeared to be tourists, carrying suitcases, whilst others were students or seemed to live here. Many of the protesters were carrying images of injuries from rubber bullets and beatings by the police. The Hong Kong police, once called “Asia’s finest”, can still justifiably be called some of the most restrained in East Asia: no live bullets have been used yet, for example, and a million marched with about ten arrests on Sunday. But even the staunchest pacifist must have some sympathy with the rage that some felt on seeing footage of the police beating those who had already been subdued, firing tear gas cannisters and rubber bullets but metres away from others without aiming upwards, and corralling journalists. As one French photojournalist remarked, he thought that he was in Hong Kong—the police weren’t supposed to shoot at them. I was not entirely sure whether I should attend in the first place; I am not from Hong Kong, after all—I do not even speak Cantonese, as I was reminded on arrival. This was, however, somewhat fortuitous, as it meant that when an organiser told those attending of a plan, I ended up in conversation with him after asking for an English translation. I suppose in the end I decided to go not because I was opposed to some internal domestic affair in Hong Kong that isn’t going the way I want, but rather because lawn bowls was cancelled, I had a rather uncomfortable feeling on seeing images of police violence in Central, a friend from Hong Kong didn’t want to go for fear of being photographed, and I very much feel that Chinese everywhere—even those who can be called “ang moh” by their Singaporean relatives with some justification—sink or swim together—if autonomous communities do not show strength towards the CCP they will simply be absorbed, and what hope there is of a better China dissolved in that process. And the reaction of my friend shows a somewhat disturbing trend from 2014. In 2014 the police did not move as rapidly; one analyst thinks that relatively sympathetic types were retired quickly, though I have not had time to look at the situation—but this is not the same police force that operated under a Secretary whose retirement in 1998 was allegedly due to his refusal to coöperate with Mainland officials. As The Guardian notes, protesters are increasingly wary of cameras, less idealistic, and more likely to resort to violence. Now Hong Kong has lost the carefree attitude of 1989, when 1.5 million protesters crowded the streets and businessmen and bankers could wear black without feeling that their jobs were under threat—when journalists at a pro-Beijing newspaper elicited cheers on waving to the crowd. Scenes of this sort are reminiscent of disturbances when blacks are shot in the United States: the police thrash, fire tear gas, and generally behave in a terribly uncivilised manner. Some might suggest that there is therefore nothing wrong with what is happening in Hong Kong. This is nonsense, because Hong Kong is a perfectly civilised place and should not therefore hold itself to the barbarian standards of a declining empire. But I am also not entirely sure that even American police officers would fire rubber bullets at people several metres away; and certainly in the United Kingdom the police normally only have batons. I remember watching a solitary police officer with a single cone preventing some protesters in drivers from reaching Parliament Square; Britain and Hong Kong share a capacity to behave in this civilised fashion, where protests take place without excessive violence from either side—and that the protest on Sunday passed without violence suggests that the police are to blame. But the other trend is a growing diversity. It used to be that the Civil Human Rights Front and the orthodox democrats operated within the legal framework in a very strict sense. They still do, but they are quite happy to rub shoulders with their more violent counterparts. The march on Sunday could not have reached a turnout of a million without substantial unity between independence supporters, orthodox pan-Democrats, and relatively apolitical people who still in some sense value Hong Kong qua Hong Kong. I cannot pretend to be entirely comfortable with all the sentiment expressed. “Hong Kong is not China!” ran one declaration—at its worst, an expression of a xenophobic and irrational sentiment towards entirely economically necessary migration and those seeking a better life, and an escape from the unfortunate truth that Hong Kong independence makes democracy less likely, in that to achieve mere democracy would require the establishment of a political climate that would still not be sufficient to manage the breakup of the motherland. And on that banner there was a British colonial flag; clearly, those holding it do not remember that the charges under which many have been charged in recent days were created by the British (as Hong Kong Watch’s report on the amusingly named Public Order Ordinance makes clear), or for that matter how the 1967 riots were dealt with. British rule certainly improved near the end—the 1995 elections were the only point at which the pan-Democrats had a legislative majority reflective of the level of public support for them, but colonial nostalgia does not really seem to be an appropriate response to neocolonialism.. At the same time, one could demand further elucidation as to why I should feel entitled to comment on the views of Hong Kong people—and to that, I do not really have an answer. As Amia Srinivasan quite clearly elucidates in a paper titled “The Aptness of Anger”, we do not measure anger by its efficacy—it is often simply apt as a reaction. And if some from Hong Kong in their anger accidentally endorse a symbol of a harmful past that has little further power, it is perhaps almost counterproductive to argue. Those who are about to be crushed can hardly be begrudged a little xenophobia. My discomfort is compounded by a likely uncharitable interpretation of one person’s eagerness to hold Benedict Rogers’ bag; in the mode of analysis of the anti-colonial left that is all too often the luxury of those who frankly did quite well out of the whole business of empire, the sight of a Chinese woman eagerly seeking to serve a white Briton was discomforting. Another complained to me of what might best be described as her excessive enthusiasm, which I shall not describe further to avoid identification. We fairly awkwardly assembled outside 7 Charles Street. Once Benedict Rogers arrived, a D4HK spokesman and he delivered statements. Nobody from the press was there, but that is unsurprising given that turnout was almost certainly under 100, and probably not much more than 40—at least in my likely inaccurate estimation. Once the speeches concluded, we chanted “No extradition to China” and various other slogans—though it is notable that everyone chanted “Hong Kong is not China” with equal vigour, with the exception of me, because I am not even sure that Hong Kong society has come to a definitive conclusion on that matter, and proper operation of One Country Two Systems would hardly be undemocratic. Benedict Rogers and the D4HK people then walked into the FCO and spent a seemingly inordinate length of the therein—quite why, I am not entirely sure—before emerging; we then walked to Downing Street to shout slogans some more. Some photos are taken, but many were reluctant to be photographed; material on the Facebook page of D4HK shows many holding up photos to obscure their faces. They are the more courageous ones. At Downing Street a fairly jovial fellow from the Metropolitan Police asks whether he can do anything and when we intend to disperse. I am not particularly kindly inclined to police officers in general, who seem to spend an awful lot of time doing various silly or morally indefensible things like disturbing black people and demanding bribes, instead of investigating burglaries, but this one seemed relatively peaceable. The outcome of the struggle is not yet clear. The President of the Legislative Council has postponed debate for two days in a row; indications in the South China Morning Post, a paper with impeccable establishment credentials as well as a still credible news-reporting operation, are that the second reading is for now not an immediate priority for the pro-Beijing camp, though the government shows no signs of definitively retracting the bill. But the sad outcome of these events is that Hong Kong has become a nastier, more violent, and more disunited society over the past few days. I doubt that the police will ever regain the trust that they lost when they threatened to fire on a mother asking them to act in a peaceful fashion, when they arrested protesters in hospital on suspicion of rioting despite their still being injured, and when they started firing even without the normal sign demanding that the crowd should disperse. Will a peaceful march of the sort that occurred on Sunday ever happen again? Fortunately, the legislative framework does not have a particularly effective ouster clause preventing judicial oversight of the decisions of the Commissioner concerning popular assembly. Yet we see also here the virtues of Hong Kong: tenacity and defiance in the face of a hopeless situation seems to have stopped the bill at least for a few days. Hong Kong has never been master of its own destiny, and nothing has changed that fundamental fact in the past few days. A long-term prognosis would not be particularly optimistic. But even in the face of such poor prospects, Hong Kong still refuses to fall silent—perhaps in the hope that they will be remembered by history; in the new China, that is an utterly forlorn hope. After the protest I place a poster reading “No China Extradition” on the door of a friend’s dormitory—we are both fairly sceptical of the CCP. One scholar complained: I was initially worried that I had accidentally stuck up a poster endorsing some of the more reactionary views held in Hong Kong at present, because I had neglected to scan the QR code—but that turned out to link to a reasonably accurate BBC article that repeated what different sides had said. The argument for the extradition bill goes something like this: bad people in China often flee to Hong Kong, and can get off scot free due to the lack of an extradition agreement. The bill would solve this gap, and so help to stop corruption on the Mainland. This is superficially plausible. However, the extradition bill would be highly unlikely to achieve the goal of reducing corruption for at least three reasons. First, the behaviour that the bill would deter is not corruption. It rather discourages behaviour that would result in being charged for corruption or murder or something else. There is ample evidence to suggest that the anti-corruption effort is principally being used for political ends—Xi’s family is suspiciously rich, after all. The extradition bill would therefore simply encourage loyalty. If anything, mudslinging between party factions is very good, because it ensures that each side has an incentive to appeal to external actors (business, intellectuals, and so on) by being less corrupt. All that is reduced when Hong Kong is no longer safe. Second, the most corrupt would not flee to Hong Kong—they can flee to the West. Most corruption is presumably due to the actions of a very small élite; Hong Kong would see prosecuted some small fish, but few big fish. Moreover Mainland authorities have effective control of all emigration, so the only people affected would have managed to escape the authorities’ notice until they had left the country. And finally, Hong Kong visas are no easier to obtain than those to other foreign countries. Third, the effective operation of the much-vaunted safeguards that would remain in s. 5 of the Fugitive Offenders Ordinance would preclude most extradition. If the courts take a reasonable view of what “political” cases are, they will rule out most extraditions of corrupt officials, since most of them will be brought to court as a result of infighting. The only situation in which the benefit from extradition would outweigh the inevitable unrest concomitant on the failure of such safeguards to operate would be in attempts to silence particularly effective dissidents or the highest-ranking officials. But our anonymous friends also wonder what the risk to Hong Kong is. At the moment Hong Kong has the most powerful opposition movement in all of China. This is not a situation with which the CCP is happy: that is why pan-democrats are often denied entry to China and attacked in state media, and why the state continues to pay the political price of avoiding democracy. An extradition bill would simply require a prima facie case for what would effectively amount to a kidnapping: all sorts of cases can be concocted, and judges convinced. A few exemplary cases against Martin Lee, Tanya Chan, and Joshua Wong would be enough to cow Hong Kong—and deprive it of some of its more effective leaders. Hong Kong is, however, supposed to be part of China—shouldn’t it therefore serve it? The process of the formation of identity is almost universally traumatic—it is undeniable that Hong Kong’s divergence from the Mainland was precipitated by the British. But we should take identities as we find them to a very great extent; we do not question the English identity because of the harrying of the north or the German identity when it was secured by blood. Identities should be judged by their present effect; the present effect of the Hong Kong identity is to demand freedom. And it is unclear why the central government is the legitimate representative of the Chinese people in the first place; it is not meaningfully elected and goes to great lengths to conceal what can be revealed about the true extent of support for it. But there is another consideration. Even if the bill has a minimal effect, it is still one more step in the salami-slicing strategy of the central government—and the only way to stop such slicing is to resist very firmly every single attempt, even if it seems disproportionate to do so. There will never be tanks or live ammunition in Hong Kong, so to simply wait till there are and then resist would be a thoroughly misguided strategy: one would simply have waited until an arrest on a charge probably concocted in the common law somewhere before being jailed in a still relatively humane jail—but with the consequence that one’s ability to dissent has been curtailed. Further reflexions Tension, and violence, escalated substantially in the aftermath of the visit to the Foreign Office. On 9 June, an estimated million marched, in a city of seven million. If there were ten million on the streets of the United Kingdom no government would last; but the government did not respond. The Wednesday thereafter the second reading of the bill was indefinitely suspended, after violent clashes at the Legislative Council. The police have, in my view rightly, been blamed for escalation then. That same day, it was announced that the second reading of the bill had been indefinitely suspended. On Sunday, two million marched, and an apology was issued. There have been a series of further clashes. Both protesters and police have been inordinately violent to each other, though in many cases it seems that the police created a wide environment of desensitisation to violence. This is true of the environment as a whole: substantial violence first occurred when the police attacked protesters outside the Legislative Council on 12 June. But it is also broadly true of individual incidents; the police did not need to enter New Town Plaza, whence the most galling and distressing footage has emerged. This is not to excuse the behaviour of individual protesters, who in one case seem to have very badly thrashed one policeman. Perhaps appropriate, it was a journalist who protected him, shouting that he was from Hong Kong too. Commentators have become increasingly distressed by this pattern of violence. It is tempting to blame protesters or police, and in individual cases this diagnosis is correct. That, however, would be to ignore the rôle of the Chief Executive in encouraging it. A leadership who truly support Hong Kong’s proud and still extant tradition of peaceful protest would not have withdrawn the bill only after violent clashes, having ignored the voice of a million people, nor would it have required the police to withdraw from a relatively defensible position in the Legislative Council, thus allowing protesters to damage the building. The message of a Chief Executive who relents only when the Legislative Council is besieged is that peaceful marches will be ignored; only violence will attract the attention of the authorities. Moreover, there is good reason to suspect that this is deliberate. First of all, Beijing are paying attention; the South China Morning Post has regularly reported on the despatch of special working groups from Beijing, and pro-Beijing newspapers have reported on the holding of meetings in Shenzhen, with one even including the Chief Executive herself. Second, it is relatively clear what the principal elements of such a plan would be. In allowing and encouraging protesters, Carrie Lam hopes to reduce overall public support for dissidents, with the end of rendering them a small minority who can easily be suppressed when the time is ripe. Violent clashes serve no purpose other than that of the establishment. This reflects an utterly contemptible attitude on the part of the Executive Council to Hong Kong. It is the height of irresponsibility to encourage the destruction of one of the most civilised political cultures in the world for short-term political gain. Pro-establishment types should think very carefully about continued support for this strategy: very few of them genuinely believe that Hong Kong is not ready for universal suffrage or a little redistribution—they support Beijing because they believe in a strategy of limited appeasement to maintain what freedoms they have. If the pan-democrats are successfully sidelined, there will be nobody left to stand up to Beijing other than them; they will no longer receive the patronage of the United Front and the Liaison Office, and will have to face Beijing’s anger—from a position of considerably greater inexperience than that of the pan-democrats. The Chief Executive risks the destruction of Hong Kong qua Hong Kong. Are these people really protesters? Martin Lee suggested not on Radio 4’s Today programme. He may well be right; there is nothing to stop the United Front or HKSAR government from sending provocateurs to implement the strategy outlined above. But there is also nothing to rule out that there are very many genuine protesters amongst the violent. The anger that seethed through students at a recent meeting in Hong Kong University when Mainland students spoke was not the ephemeral product of internal university complaints. A large part of Hong Kong is unspeakably angered by the police, government, and Beijing. Some of them have lost hope due to economic conditions. It is all too plausible that some have been driven to the point of thrashing the police, and that they are not in fact principally provocateurs.">

A leadership who truly support Hong Kong’s proud and still extant tradition of peaceful protest would not have withdrawn the bill only after violent clashes, having ignored the voice of a million people, nor would it have required the police to withdraw from a relatively defensible position in the Legislative Council, thus allowing protesters to damage the building. The message of a Chief Executive who relents only when the Legislative Council is besieged is that peaceful marches will be ignored; only violence will attract the attention of the authorities. Moreover, there is good reason to suspect that this is deliberate. First of all, Beijing are paying attention; the South China Morning Post has regularly reported on the despatch of special working groups from Beijing, and pro-Beijing newspapers have reported on the holding of meetings in Shenzhen, with one even including the Chief Executive herself. Second, it is relatively clear what the principal elements of such a plan would be. In allowing and encouraging protesters, Carrie Lam hopes to reduce overall public support for dissidents, with the end of rendering them a small minority who can easily be suppressed when the time is ripe. Violent clashes serve no purpose other than that of the establishment. This reflects an utterly contemptible attitude on the part of the Executive Council to Hong Kong. It is the height of irresponsibility to encourage the destruction of one of the most civilised political cultures in the world for short-term political gain. Pro-establishment types should think very carefully about continued support for this strategy: very few of them genuinely believe that Hong Kong is not ready for universal suffrage or a little redistribution—they support Beijing because they believe in a strategy of limited appeasement to maintain what freedoms they have. If the pan-democrats are successfully sidelined, there will be nobody left to stand up to Beijing other than them; they will no longer receive the patronage of the United Front and the Liaison Office, and will have to face Beijing’s anger—from a position of considerably greater inexperience than that of the pan-democrats. The Chief Executive risks the destruction of Hong Kong qua Hong Kong. Are these people really protesters? Martin Lee suggested not on Radio 4’s Today programme. He may well be right; there is nothing to stop the United Front or HKSAR government from sending provocateurs to implement the strategy outlined above. But there is also nothing to rule out that there are very many genuine protesters amongst the violent. The anger that seethed through students at a recent meeting in Hong Kong University when Mainland students spoke was not the ephemeral product of internal university complaints. A large part of Hong Kong is unspeakably angered by the police, government, and Beijing. Some of them have lost hope due to economic conditions. It is all too plausible that some have been driven to the point of thrashing the police, and that they are not in fact principally provocateurs.">

    <h2 id="june">13 June</h2>
<p>On Sunday, a million marched in Hong Kong against a bill that would permit extradition, to, inter alia, mainland China. The usual suspects of course appeared: pan-Democratic veterans, independence supporters, and students; but as the international press do not tire of noting, businesses, former officials, and even religious groups find themselves concerned by the bill. The risk is to Hong Kong qua Hong Kong, i.e., the only free Chinese city outside Taiwan on earth, and the legal innovation that Hong Kong’s common law represents.</p>
<p>Sunday also saw perhaps thousands marching in overseas; in London, about 4,000 appeared at a protest organised by a group called “Democracy for Hong Kong” (D4HK). On Thursday, it delivered a letter to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, urging the British government to discharge its moral and legal duties to the people of Hong Kong. The principal demands made were further statements against the bill, a clear condemnation of police violence in the week after Sunday, a coalition with other governments to oppose the bill, a declaration of a breach of the Sino-British Joint Declaration in the event that the bill is passed, the inclusion of civil liberties in any trade deal with China, and action to protect the rights of holders of British National (Overseas) passports in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Those attending the protest were largely Cantonese-speaking Hong Kong people; some appeared to be tourists, carrying suitcases, whilst others were students or seemed to live here. Many of the protesters were carrying images of injuries from rubber bullets and beatings by the police. The Hong Kong police, once called “Asia’s finest”, can still justifiably be called some of the most restrained in East Asia: no live bullets have been used yet, for example, and a million marched with about ten arrests on Sunday. But even the staunchest pacifist must have some sympathy with the rage that some felt on seeing footage of the police beating those who had already been subdued, firing tear gas cannisters and rubber bullets but metres away from others without aiming upwards, and corralling journalists. As one French photojournalist remarked, he thought that he was in Hong Kong—the police weren’t supposed to shoot at them.</p>
<p>I was not entirely sure whether I should attend in the first place; I am not from Hong Kong, after all—I do not even speak Cantonese, as I was reminded on arrival. This was, however, somewhat fortuitous, as it meant that when an organiser told those attending of a plan, I ended up in conversation with him after asking for an English translation. I suppose in the end I decided to go not because I was opposed to some internal domestic affair in Hong Kong that isn’t going the way I want, but rather because lawn bowls was cancelled, I had a rather uncomfortable feeling on seeing images of police violence in Central, a friend from Hong Kong didn’t want to go for fear of being photographed, and I very much feel that Chinese everywhere—even those who can be called “ang moh” by their Singaporean relatives with some justification—sink or swim together—if autonomous communities do not show strength towards the CCP they will simply be absorbed, and what hope there is of a better China dissolved in that process.</p>
<p>And the reaction of my friend shows a somewhat disturbing trend from 2014. In 2014 the police did not move as rapidly; one analyst thinks that relatively sympathetic types were retired quickly, though I have not had time to look at the situation—but this is not the same police force that operated under a Secretary whose retirement in 1998 was allegedly due to his refusal to coöperate with Mainland officials. As The Guardian notes, protesters are increasingly wary of cameras, less idealistic, and more likely to resort to violence. Now Hong Kong has lost the carefree attitude of 1989, when 1.5 million protesters crowded the streets and businessmen and bankers could wear black without feeling that their jobs were under threat—when journalists at a pro-Beijing newspaper elicited cheers on waving to the crowd.</p>
<p>Scenes of this sort are reminiscent of disturbances when blacks are shot in the United States: the police thrash, fire tear gas, and generally behave in a terribly uncivilised manner. Some might suggest that there is therefore nothing wrong with what is happening in Hong Kong. This is nonsense, because Hong Kong is a perfectly civilised place and should not therefore hold itself to the barbarian standards of a declining empire. But I am also not entirely sure that even American police officers would fire rubber bullets at people several metres away; and certainly in the United Kingdom the police normally only have batons. I remember watching a solitary police officer with a single cone preventing some protesters in drivers from reaching Parliament Square; Britain and Hong Kong share a capacity to behave in this civilised fashion, where protests take place without excessive violence from either side—and that the protest on Sunday passed without violence suggests that the police are to blame.</p>
<p>But the other trend is a growing diversity. It used to be that the Civil Human Rights Front and the orthodox democrats operated within the legal framework in a very strict sense. They still do, but they are quite happy to rub shoulders with their more violent counterparts. The march on Sunday could not have reached a turnout of a million without substantial unity between independence supporters, orthodox pan-Democrats, and relatively apolitical people who still in some sense value Hong Kong qua Hong Kong. I cannot pretend to be entirely comfortable with all the sentiment expressed. “Hong Kong is not China!” ran one declaration—at its worst, an expression of a xenophobic and irrational sentiment towards entirely economically necessary migration and those seeking a better life, and an escape from the unfortunate truth that Hong Kong independence makes democracy less likely, in that to achieve mere democracy would require the establishment of a political climate that would still not be sufficient to manage the breakup of the motherland. And on that banner there was a British colonial flag; clearly, those holding it do not remember that the charges under which many have been charged in recent days were created by the British (as Hong Kong Watch’s report on the amusingly named Public Order Ordinance makes clear), or for that matter how the 1967 riots were dealt with. British rule certainly improved near the end—the 1995 elections were the only point at which the pan-Democrats had a legislative majority reflective of the level of public support for them, but colonial nostalgia does not really seem to be an appropriate response to neocolonialism..</p>
<p>At the same time, one could demand further elucidation as to why I should feel entitled to comment on the views of Hong Kong people—and to that, I do not really have an answer. As Amia Srinivasan quite clearly elucidates in a paper titled “The Aptness of Anger”, we do not measure anger by its efficacy—it is often simply apt as a reaction. And if some from Hong Kong in their anger accidentally endorse a symbol of a harmful past that has little further power, it is perhaps almost counterproductive to argue. Those who are about to be crushed can hardly be begrudged a little xenophobia. My discomfort is compounded by a likely uncharitable interpretation of one person’s eagerness to hold Benedict Rogers’ bag; in the mode of analysis of the anti-colonial left that is all too often the luxury of those who frankly did quite well out of the whole business of empire, the sight of a Chinese woman eagerly seeking to serve a white Briton was discomforting. Another complained to me of what might best be described as her excessive enthusiasm, which I shall not describe further to avoid identification.</p>
<p>We fairly awkwardly assembled outside 7 Charles Street. Once Benedict Rogers arrived, a D4HK spokesman and he delivered statements. Nobody from the press was there, but that is unsurprising given that turnout was almost certainly under 100, and probably not much more than 40—at least in my likely inaccurate estimation. Once the speeches concluded, we chanted “No extradition to China” and various other slogans—though it is notable that everyone chanted “Hong Kong is not China” with equal vigour, with the exception of me, because I am not even sure that Hong Kong society has come to a definitive conclusion on that matter, and proper operation of One Country Two Systems would hardly be undemocratic. Benedict Rogers and the D4HK people then walked into the FCO and spent a seemingly inordinate length of the therein—quite why, I am not entirely sure—before emerging; we then walked to Downing Street to shout slogans some more. Some photos are taken, but many were reluctant to be photographed; material on the Facebook page of D4HK shows many holding up photos to obscure their faces. They are the more courageous ones. At Downing Street a fairly jovial fellow from the Metropolitan Police asks whether he can do anything and when we intend to disperse. I am not particularly kindly inclined to police officers in general, who seem to spend an awful lot of time doing various silly or morally indefensible things like disturbing black people and demanding bribes, instead of investigating burglaries, but this one seemed relatively peaceable.</p>
<p>The outcome of the struggle is not yet clear. The President of the Legislative Council has postponed debate for two days in a row; indications in the South China Morning Post, a paper with impeccable establishment credentials as well as a still credible news-reporting operation, are that the second reading is for now not an immediate priority for the pro-Beijing camp, though the government shows no signs of definitively retracting the bill. But the sad outcome of these events is that Hong Kong has become a nastier, more violent, and more disunited society over the past few days. I doubt that the police will ever regain the trust that they lost when they threatened to fire on a mother asking them to act in a peaceful fashion, when they arrested protesters in hospital on suspicion of rioting despite their still being injured, and when they started firing even without the normal sign demanding that the crowd should disperse. Will a peaceful march of the sort that occurred on Sunday ever happen again? Fortunately, the legislative framework does not have a particularly effective ouster clause preventing judicial oversight of the decisions of the Commissioner concerning popular assembly. Yet we see also here the virtues of Hong Kong: tenacity and defiance in the face of a hopeless situation seems to have stopped the bill at least for a few days.</p>
<p>Hong Kong has never been master of its own destiny, and nothing has changed that fundamental fact in the past few days. A long-term prognosis would not be particularly optimistic. But even in the face of such poor prospects, Hong Kong still refuses to fall silent—perhaps in the hope that they will be remembered by history; in the new China, that is an utterly forlorn hope.</p>
<p>After the protest I place a poster reading “No China Extradition” on the door of a friend’s dormitory—we are both fairly sceptical of the CCP. One scholar complained: I was initially worried that I had accidentally stuck up a poster endorsing some of the more reactionary views held in Hong Kong at present, because I had neglected to scan the QR code—but that turned out to link to a reasonably accurate BBC article that repeated what different sides had said.</p>
<p>The argument for the extradition bill goes something like this: bad people in China often flee to Hong Kong, and can get off scot free due to the lack of an extradition agreement. The bill would solve this gap, and so help to stop corruption on the Mainland. This is superficially plausible. However, the extradition bill would be highly unlikely to achieve the goal of reducing corruption for at least three reasons.</p>
<p>First, the behaviour that the bill would deter is not corruption. It rather discourages behaviour that would result in being charged for corruption or murder or something else. There is ample evidence to suggest that the anti-corruption effort is principally being used for political ends—Xi’s family is suspiciously rich, after all. The extradition bill would therefore simply encourage loyalty. If anything, mudslinging between party factions is very good, because it ensures that each side has an incentive to appeal to external actors (business, intellectuals, and so on) by being less corrupt. All that is reduced when Hong Kong is no longer safe.</p>
<p>Second, the most corrupt would not flee to Hong Kong—they can flee to the West. Most corruption is presumably due to the actions of a very small élite; Hong Kong would see prosecuted some small fish, but few big fish. Moreover Mainland authorities have effective control of all emigration, so the only people affected would have managed to escape the authorities’ notice until they had left the country. And finally, Hong Kong visas are no easier to obtain than those to other foreign countries.</p>
<p>Third, the effective operation of the much-vaunted safeguards that would remain in s. 5 of the Fugitive Offenders Ordinance would preclude most extradition. If the courts take a reasonable view of what “political” cases are, they will rule out most extraditions of corrupt officials, since most of them will be brought to court as a result of infighting. The only situation in which the benefit from extradition would outweigh the inevitable unrest concomitant on the failure of such safeguards to operate would be in attempts to silence particularly effective dissidents or the highest-ranking officials.</p>
<p>But our anonymous friends also wonder what the risk to Hong Kong is. At the moment Hong Kong has the most powerful opposition movement in all of China. This is not a situation with which the CCP is happy: that is why pan-democrats are often denied entry to China and attacked in state media, and why the state continues to pay the political price of avoiding democracy. An extradition bill would simply require a prima facie case for what would effectively amount to a kidnapping: all sorts of cases can be concocted, and judges convinced. A few exemplary cases against Martin Lee, Tanya Chan, and Joshua Wong would be enough to cow Hong Kong—and deprive it of some of its more effective leaders.</p>
<p>Hong Kong is, however, supposed to be part of China—shouldn’t it therefore serve it? The process of the formation of identity is almost universally traumatic—it is undeniable that Hong Kong’s divergence from the Mainland was precipitated by the British. But we should take identities as we find them to a very great extent; we do not question the English identity because of the harrying of the north or the German identity when it was secured by blood. Identities should be judged by their present effect; the present effect of the Hong Kong identity is to demand freedom. And it is unclear why the central government is the legitimate representative of the Chinese people in the first place; it is not meaningfully elected and goes to great lengths to conceal what can be revealed about the true extent of support for it.</p>
<p>But there is another consideration. Even if the bill has a minimal effect, it is still one more step in the salami-slicing strategy of the central government—and the only way to stop such slicing is to resist very firmly every single attempt, even if it seems disproportionate to do so. There will never be tanks or live ammunition in Hong Kong, so to simply wait till there are and then resist would be a thoroughly misguided strategy: one would simply have waited until an arrest on a charge probably concocted in the common law somewhere before being jailed in a still relatively humane jail—but with the consequence that one’s ability to dissent has been curtailed.</p>
<h2 id="further-reflexions">Further reflexions</h2>
<p>Tension, and violence, escalated substantially in the aftermath of the visit to the Foreign Office. On 9 June, an estimated million marched, in a city of seven million. If there were ten million on the streets of the United Kingdom no government would last; but the government did not respond. The Wednesday thereafter the second reading of the bill was indefinitely suspended, after violent clashes at the Legislative Council. The police have, in my view rightly, been blamed for escalation then. That same day, it was announced that the second reading of the bill had been indefinitely suspended. On Sunday, two million marched, and an apology was issued.</p>
<p>There have been a series of further clashes. Both protesters and police have been inordinately violent to each other, though in many cases it seems that the police created a wide environment of desensitisation to violence. This is true of the environment as a whole: substantial violence first occurred when the police attacked protesters outside the Legislative Council on 12 June. But it is also broadly true of individual incidents; the police did not need to enter New Town Plaza, whence the most galling and distressing footage has emerged. This is not to excuse the behaviour of individual protesters, who in one case seem to have very badly thrashed one policeman. Perhaps appropriate, it was a journalist who protected him, shouting that he was from Hong Kong too.</p>
<p>Commentators have become increasingly distressed by this pattern of violence. It is tempting to blame protesters or police, and in individual cases this diagnosis is correct. That, however, would be to ignore the rôle of the Chief Executive in encouraging it. A leadership who truly support Hong Kong’s proud and still extant tradition of peaceful protest would not have withdrawn the bill only after violent clashes, having ignored the voice of a million people, nor would it have required the police to withdraw from a relatively defensible position in the Legislative Council, thus allowing protesters to damage the building. The message of a Chief Executive who relents only when the Legislative Council is besieged is that peaceful marches will be ignored; only violence will attract the attention of the authorities.</p>
<p>Moreover, there is good reason to suspect that this is deliberate. First of all, Beijing are paying attention; the South China Morning Post has regularly reported on the despatch of special working groups from Beijing, and pro-Beijing newspapers have reported on the holding of meetings in Shenzhen, with one even including the Chief Executive herself. Second, it is relatively clear what the principal elements of such a plan would be. In allowing and encouraging protesters, Carrie Lam hopes to reduce overall public support for dissidents, with the end of rendering them a small minority who can easily be suppressed when the time is ripe. Violent clashes serve no purpose other than that of the establishment.</p>
<p>This reflects an utterly contemptible attitude on the part of the Executive Council to Hong Kong. It is the height of irresponsibility to encourage the destruction of one of the most civilised political cultures in the world for short-term political gain. Pro-establishment types should think very carefully about continued support for this strategy: very few of them genuinely believe that Hong Kong is not ready for universal suffrage or a little redistribution—they support Beijing because they believe in a strategy of limited appeasement to maintain what freedoms they have. If the pan-democrats are successfully sidelined, there will be nobody left to stand up to Beijing other than them; they will no longer receive the patronage of the United Front and the Liaison Office, and will have to face Beijing’s anger—from a position of considerably greater inexperience than that of the pan-democrats. The Chief Executive risks the destruction of Hong Kong qua Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Are these people really protesters? Martin Lee suggested not on Radio 4’s Today programme. He may well be right; there is nothing to stop the United Front or HKSAR government from sending provocateurs to implement the strategy outlined above. But there is also nothing to rule out that there are very many genuine protesters amongst the violent. The anger that seethed through students at a recent meeting in Hong Kong University when Mainland students spoke was not the ephemeral product of internal university complaints. A large part of Hong Kong is unspeakably angered by the police, government, and Beijing. Some of them have lost hope due to economic conditions. It is all too plausible that some have been driven to the point of thrashing the police, and that they are not in fact principally provocateurs.</p>
