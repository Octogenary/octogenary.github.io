  <title>The rule of law: my letter appears in the SCMP</title>
  <meta name="description" content="Today my letter1 appeared in the South China Morning Post. The original text I sent follows. I did write this letter rather hastily, because a previous letter I wrote in response to a column2 by Alex Lo3 was not published. Edwin Choy (14 Oct) writes that perpetrators of “violence, vandalism and other crimes should know from those practising law that their acts constitute serious crimes and are not tolerable in any civilised society.” But the law is never threatened simply because some violate it; it is threatened by the corruption of the institutions that are supposed to uphold it, which Choy skillfully manages to elide in saying merely that “there may be indications that some police officers have used excessive force when dealing with the rioters.” On 21 July we learnt that the police cannot be trusted to side with the public against triads. On 31 August we learnt that the police consider themselves to be one party of a conflict the other party to which is the public. And from June to October we have learnt that the police have come to see those whom they are meant to serve not as citizens but as “cockroaches.” Society can reasonably expect adherence to the rule of law in the way Choy advocates when basic requirements of procedural fairness are met by the police, as they have manifestly not been over the past months. Of course some actions should still be condemned, but not simply in virtue of their illegality; rather, they militate against the principles of justice the achievement of which motivates our creation of the law. The only way that such requirements could be restored is through an independent commission of inquiry—a sensible path that as Choy knows many protesters advocate. As I wrote on Facebook,4 Amusingly, my letter is published next to one from one of the most distinguished barristers in Hong Kong in support of Mr Choy. He asks those in agreement with him to “stand up and be counted”: to that I should say that they had their chance in the last elections to the Bar Council, in which over 80% of those eligible voted. Philip Dykes’ stand against threats to the rule of law from both police and protesters was exactly the sort of approach one would have expected from him. Cheng Huan and Mr Choy ought not to assume that they have the backing of a silent majority: a vocal majority seem to have indicated otherwise.
