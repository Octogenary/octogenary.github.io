  <title>Firing of a water cannon outside Kowloon Mosque: my letter to the SCMP</title>
  <meta name="description" content="A march led in their personal capacities by members of the Civil Human Rights Front1 took place on 20th October (Sunday). Jimmy Sham, a prominent member of the Front, was attacked earlier that week by what were alleged to be South Asian assailants, which lead some to demand retribution; members of the pan-democratic camp and Jimmy Sham himself urged others to support ethnic harmony and refrain from blaming ethnic minorities as a whole. Some members of the camp as well as ethnic minority Hongkongers assembled outside Chungking Mansions and Kowloon Mosque, two sites important to the South Asian community; at Chungking Mansions, the gathering was uninterrupted and bottled water was handed out. At Kowloon Mosque, however, the police fired a spray so vile that some were sent to hospital at those outside the mosque. Some of the dyed water also hit the mosque, revealing the police’s cavalier attitude to ethnic minorities and other people. The incident has attracted rather a lot of attention in the international and local media.2 The police have apologised to the mosque and one person outside—Mohan Chugani—who has previously appeared at police rallies.3 The SCMP view this as adequate and wrote an editorial urging calm after the incident.4 In response, I wrote: The editorial of 21 October manages to omit two important points about the firing of a water cannon at Kowloon Mosque. First, the police have apologised only to the mosque, but still accuse those outside of being “dangerous rioters”. This is a blatant falsehood. Video footage shows a few people standing outside peacefully. They included Mohan Chugani, a businessman who has previously spoken at a pro-police rally, and several journalists. It borders on absurdity to call them rioters. Once again the police have chosen to obfuscate instead of acknowledging wrongdoing and apologising. Second, it is not helpful to smugly claim that “[d]iversity and tolerance have long been seen as characteristic of Hong Kong” when there is so much more to do. The government are complicit in widespread racism: racial discrimination by the police, an educational system that leaves South Asians behind, and discriminatory immigration policy are longstanding grievances that must be addressed. The contrast between a spontaneous move by ordinary citizens to clean the mosque and the tokenistic wheeling out of ethnic minority officers by the police suggests that the people care more about ethnic minorities than the government. We shall see whether this letter is published. Vide their Facebook. An application was made to the police in the name of the Front to hold the march, but the police issued a letter of objection under the Public Order Ordinance: “Public Order Ordinance (Cap. 245)” (1967), https://www.elegislation.gov.hk/hk/cap245↩︎ Greg Torode and James Pomfret, “Hong Kong Riot Police Teargas, Chase Protesters, Residents Jeer Officers,” Reuters, October 21, 2019, https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hongkong-protests-idUSKBN1X004X; “Hong Kong Riot Police Fire Tear Gas at Pro-Democracy Demonstrators,” The Irish Times, October 21, 2019, https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/asia-pacific/hong-kong-riot-police-fire-tear-gas-at-pro-democracy-demonstrators-1.4057639; “Hong Kong Leaders Apologise to Mosque After Police Sprayed It with Dye,” Mail Online, October 21, 2019, https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7595205/Hong-Kong-leaders-apologize-mosque-water-cannon-hit.html; Kris Cheng, “Victims of Water Cannon Outside Kowloon Mosque File Complaints Against Hong Kong Police,” Hong Kong Free Press, October 22, 2019, https://www.hongkongfp.com/2019/10/22/victims-water-cannon-outside-kowloon-mosque-file-complaints-hong-kong-police/↩︎ Alvin Lum and Chan Ho-him, “Hong Kong Leader Apologises After Water Cannon Sprays Mosque Entrance,” South China Morning Post, October 21, 2019, https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3033843/hong-kong-protests-city-leader-carrie-lam-and-police-chief.↩︎ Editorial, “Apology for Firing Water Cannon at Hong Kong Mosque Is a Welcome Move,” South China Morning Post, October 21, 2019, https://www.scmp.com/comment/opinion/article/3033930/apology-muslim-community-over-firing-water-cannon-mosque-welcome↩︎">
