          <p>I recently wrote a letter about an attack by the police with a water cannon on people outside Kowloon Mosque. In searching for it on the SCMP’s website I found another letter of mine.<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alex Lo (“Protesters see the police as an occupation force ”, September 1) suggests that the reason protesters are angered by the actions of the police, even though many Western police forces are more violent, is that they are viewed as an occupation force. There are two problems with this claim.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>First, the police have in some instances gone beyond international norms: they have beaten commuters on trains, collaborated with or at least turned a blind eye to triad violence against even those who were not involved in the protests, and routinely fired tear gas in dense residential areas. The police claimed that some protesters had changed clothes, as if that would justify thrashing people who were most likely uninvolved passengers. This would not be normal in most European states.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Second, Hongkongers rightly expect higher standards than those in the West. That is because Hong Kong has surpassed the West in many respects. Would Lo wonder why there are complaints about MTR delays that would seem normal in London? Of course he wouldn’t, and that is why it is so ludicrous to think that Hongkongers’ higher expectations need an explanation. Perhaps many Europeans are resigned to the wanton excesses of their police; Hong Kong people aren’t yet.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Lo also wonders why many seem to tolerate violence. I suggest he ask the chief executive. After all, the extradition amendment bill was suspended only after an unlawful assembly on June 12, when a peaceful march by a million people on June 9 had no such impact.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I hope this serves to address the common argument online that the Hong Kong police are merely copying their Western counterparts and so should not be criticised.</p>

          <p>In generating this website I use a combination of Jekyll<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> and Pandoc.<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Pandoc converts Markdown files into HTML; I use it because it supports Citation Style Language (CSL),<a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> which Jekyll’s default Markdown processors do not.</p>
<p>I am generally of the view that footnotes are the most civilised way to cite others, though my justifications for this mainly apply to books. However, I am a creature of habit, and so like to have full footnotes in lieu of a bibliography when writing on-line too. However, Pandoc seemed to generate both a bibliography and full footnotes, which looked fairly bizarre.<a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>It turns out that CSL is not as alien as I thought; all that one needs to do to fix this is to remove everything between the <code>&lt;bibliography&gt;</code> tags on one’s local copy of the CSL file to cause the bibliography to disappear.</p>

        <div class="post-content">
          <p>A march led in their personal capacities by members of the Civil Human Rights Front<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> took place on 20th October (Sunday). Jimmy Sham, a prominent member of the Front, was attacked earlier that week by what were alleged to be South Asian assailants, which lead some to demand retribution; members of the pan-democratic camp and Jimmy Sham himself urged others to support ethnic harmony and refrain from blaming ethnic minorities as a whole.</p>
<p>Some members of the camp as well as ethnic minority Hongkongers assembled outside Chungking Mansions and Kowloon Mosque, two sites important to the South Asian community; at Chungking Mansions, the gathering was uninterrupted and bottled water was handed out. At Kowloon Mosque, however, the police fired a spray so vile that some were sent to hospital at those outside the mosque. Some of the dyed water also hit the mosque, revealing the police’s cavalier attitude to ethnic minorities and other people.</p>
<p>The incident has attracted rather a lot of attention in the international and local media.<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> The police have apologised to the mosque and one person outside—Mohan Chugani—who has previously appeared at police rallies.<span class="citation"><a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></span> The <em>SCMP</em> view this as adequate and wrote an editorial urging calm after the incident.<a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>In response, I wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The editorial of 21 October manages to omit two important points about the firing of a water cannon at Kowloon Mosque. First, the police have apologised only to the mosque, but still accuse those outside of being “dangerous rioters”. This is a blatant falsehood. Video footage shows a few people standing outside peacefully. They included Mohan Chugani, a businessman who has previously spoken at a pro-police rally, and several journalists. It borders on absurdity to call them rioters. Once again the police have chosen to obfuscate instead of acknowledging wrongdoing and apologising.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Second, it is not helpful to smugly claim that “[d]iversity and tolerance have long been seen as characteristic of Hong Kong” when there is so much more to do. The government are complicit in widespread racism: racial discrimination by the police, an educational system that leaves South Asians behind, and discriminatory immigration policy are longstanding grievances that must be addressed. The contrast between a spontaneous move by ordinary citizens to clean the mosque and the tokenistic wheeling out of ethnic minority officers by the police suggests that the people care more about ethnic minorities than the government.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We shall see whether this letter is published.</p>

          <p>Today my letter<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> appeared in the <em>South China Morning Post</em>. The original text I sent follows. I did write this letter rather hastily, because a previous letter I wrote in response to a column<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> by Alex Lo<a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> was not published.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Edwin Choy (14 Oct) writes that perpetrators of “violence, vandalism and other crimes should know from those practising law that their acts constitute serious crimes and are not tolerable in any civilised society.” But the law is never threatened simply because some violate it; it is threatened by the corruption of the institutions that are supposed to uphold it, which Choy skillfully manages to elide in saying merely that “there may be indications that some police officers have used excessive force when dealing with the rioters.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>On 21 July we learnt that the police cannot be trusted to side with the public against triads. On 31 August we learnt that the police consider themselves to be one party of a conflict the other party to which is the public. And from June to October we have learnt that the police have come to see those whom they are meant to serve not as citizens but as “cockroaches.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Society can reasonably expect adherence to the rule of law in the way Choy advocates when basic requirements of procedural fairness are met by the police, as they have manifestly not been over the past months. Of course some actions should still be condemned, but not simply in virtue of their illegality; rather, they militate against the principles of justice the achievement of which motivates our creation of the law. The only way that such requirements could be restored is through an independent commission of inquiry—a sensible path that as Choy knows many protesters advocate.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As I wrote on Facebook,<a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Amusingly, my letter is published next to one from one of the most distinguished barristers in Hong Kong in support of Mr Choy. He asks those in agreement with him to “stand up and be counted”: to that I should say that they had their chance in the last elections to the Bar Council, in which over 80% of those eligible voted. Philip Dykes’ stand against threats to the rule of law from both police and protesters was exactly the sort of approach one would have expected from him. Cheng Huan and Mr Choy ought not to assume that they have the backing of a silent majority: a vocal majority seem to have indicated otherwise.</p>

          <p>We write to strongly protest the decision of Locke to invite Katie Hopkins.</p>
<p>It is inevitable that discourse will render some uncomfortable, and there is reasonable disagreement as to the priority that should be given to discourse over the safety and feelings of safety of members of the school community.</p>
<p>This letter has little to do with such concerns: Hopkins’ statements bear little resemblance to any possible form of reasoned argument, and to the extent that coherent claims emerge, it should be quite obvious both that Hopkins’ statements bear little relation to facts, and that Hopkins’ value judgements largely consist of support for violence and terror for their own sakes. It therefore seems difficult to reconcile Hopkin’s rejection of reason with any reasonable conception of discourse.</p>
<p>Civility may demand that we should not rescind an invitation once it has been granted. What is clear is that there should not be a repeat of this sort of situation. The superficial resemblance between the promotion of offence as inherently beneficial and an acceptance that honest debate sometimes will make others uncomfortable masks the costs of this decision. An invitation implies that the speaker in question at least has something cogent to say. If the school must metaëthically err in rejecting the import of feelings, perhaps it will care for the damage to epistemic virtue inherent to any endorsement of one who spurns it.</p>
