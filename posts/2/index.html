          <p>Today my letter<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> appeared in the <em>South China Morning Post</em>. The original text I sent follows. I did write this letter rather hastily, because a previous letter I wrote in response to a column<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> by Alex Lo<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> was not published.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Edwin Choy (14 Oct) writes that perpetrators of “violence, vandalism and other crimes should know from those practising law that their acts constitute serious crimes and are not tolerable in any civilised society.” But the law is never threatened simply because some violate it; it is threatened by the corruption of the institutions that are supposed to uphold it, which Choy skillfully manages to elide in saying merely that “there may be indications that some police officers have used excessive force when dealing with the rioters.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>On 21 July we learnt that the police cannot be trusted to side with the public against triads. On 31 August we learnt that the police consider themselves to be one party of a conflict the other party to which is the public. And from June to October we have learnt that the police have come to see those whom they are meant to serve not as citizens but as “cockroaches.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Society can reasonably expect adherence to the rule of law in the way Choy advocates when basic requirements of procedural fairness are met by the police, as they have manifestly not been over the past months. Of course some actions should still be condemned, but not simply in virtue of their illegality; rather, they militate against the principles of justice the achievement of which motivates our creation of the law. The only way that such requirements could be restored is through an independent commission of inquiry—a sensible path that as Choy knows many protesters advocate.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As I wrote on Facebook,<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Amusingly, my letter is published next to one from one of the most distinguished barristers in Hong Kong in support of Mr Choy. He asks those in agreement with him to “stand up and be counted”: to that I should say that they had their chance in the last elections to the Bar Council, in which over 80% of those eligible voted. Philip Dykes’ stand against threats to the rule of law from both police and protesters was exactly the sort of approach one would have expected from him. Cheng Huan and Mr Choy ought not to assume that they have the backing of a silent majority: a vocal majority seem to have indicated otherwise.</p>

          <p>We write to strongly protest the decision of Locke to invite Katie Hopkins.</p>
<p>It is inevitable that discourse will render some uncomfortable, and there is reasonable disagreement as to the priority that should be given to discourse over the safety and feelings of safety of members of the school community.</p>
<p>This letter has little to do with such concerns: Hopkins’ statements bear little resemblance to any possible form of reasoned argument, and to the extent that coherent claims emerge, it should be quite obvious both that Hopkins’ statements bear little relation to facts, and that Hopkins’ value judgements largely consist of support for violence and terror for their own sakes. It therefore seems difficult to reconcile Hopkin’s rejection of reason with any reasonable conception of discourse.</p>
<p>Civility may demand that we should not rescind an invitation once it has been granted. What is clear is that there should not be a repeat of this sort of situation. The superficial resemblance between the promotion of offence as inherently beneficial and an acceptance that honest debate sometimes will make others uncomfortable masks the costs of this decision. An invitation implies that the speaker in question at least has something cogent to say. If the school must metaëthically err in rejecting the import of feelings, perhaps it will care for the damage to epistemic virtue inherent to any endorsement of one who spurns it.</p>
