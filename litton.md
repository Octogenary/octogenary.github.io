>The judgment is over 100 pages, replete with references to authorities from America, Canada, Europe, South Africa, England and Australia, barely intelligible to lawyers and totally incomprehensible to the ordinary person.

Of course, as noted above, Litton omits to note that the government he supports in writing this article was the reason that the courts had to consider these foreign authorities! In any case, Litton himself is a foreign authority of sorts, or at least an imported authority. It is bizarre that someone so steeped in the common law should suddenly become so opposed to its continued operation.

>48 hours from the time of arrest: adequate for normal investigations….but totally inadequate in these exceptional times. …The High Court judgment now makes it impossible for the government to invoke powers under Cap. 241 to extend the lawful period of detention.

This seems to misconstrue the reasoning in the judgement.

On proportionailty:

> [para. 189] There is practically no limit on the circumstances in which the power under that section can be exercised by a police officer, save the requirement that (i) the person is in a public place, and (ii) the facial covering used by that person is reasonably believed by the police officer to be likely to prevent identification.  The power can be exercised irrespective of whether there is any public meeting or procession taking place in the vicinity, and regardless of whether there is any risk of outbreak of violence or other criminal acts, at the place where the person is found, or in the neighbourhood, or indeed anywhere else in Hong Kong.  The power may, on its face, be used by a police officer for random stoppage of anyone found wearing a facial covering in any public place.  We consider it to be clear that the measure adopted by s 5 of the PFCR exceeds what is reasonably necessary to achieve the aim of law enforcement, investigation and prosecution of violent protesters even in the prevailing turbulent circumstances in Hong Kong, and that it fails to strike a reasonable balance between the societal benefits promoted and the inroads made into the protected rights.

> [para. 191] For the above reasons, while there are legitimate societal objects to the pursuit of which the measure introduced by s 5 is rationally connected, s 5 represents a more serious inroad into protected rights than is reasonably necessary, and therefore fails the proportionality test.
