  <title>Henry Litton</title>
  <meta name="description" content="My letter to the South China Morning Post— Reasonable disagreement is a fact of life, and Henry Litton (“Why challengers of Hong Kong’s anti-mask law have no case”, 20 Jan) surely has good reasons for his views. But he writes such as as to give the misleading impression that the court had not addressed any of the issues he raises. Litton writes that, because “the laws on the statute book were scrutinised and some were culled”, those that were not must “remain intact”; since the Emergency Regulations Ordinance was not culled, it must therefore be constitutional. Yet even the respondents “only rely on this as a factor in favour of validity, and do not submit that the absence of rejection by the NPCSC…preclud[es] any future finding that the ERO contravenes the Basic Law.” Moreover, as noted by the court, article 160 of the Basic Law provides that “[i]f any laws are later discovered to be in contravention of this Law, they shall be amended or cease to have force in accordance with the procedure as prescribed by this Law.” He then complains that the court paid far too much attention to “cases which had no relevance whatsoever to a proper interpretation of the Basic Law.” Litton says of Henry VIII clauses that the eponymous king “died in 1547.” It is simply puerile to dismiss precedent because it is old. Moreover the court only considered such cases because the defence of the mask law relied on them—and it rejected them, noting that “the LegCo does not enjoy such supremacy in the Diceyan sense.” Would Litton rather that judges ignored what the parties said if they disagreed with it? Of the applicants, Litton says that “they had no rights or interests in the enactment of the face-mask regulation greater than anyone else”, because they had not “been stopped by the police” under the regulation. But perhaps then everyone has locus standi, since everyone is unconstitutionally prohibited from wearing a mask: or is Litton saying that locus standi evaporates because others can claim it? Further, Litton ignores the argument about separation of powers, by which LegCo members clearly also are concerned. Failure to charitably respond to others’ arguments has in part created the present crisis. Of a former judge of the Court of the Final Appeal, we surely have the right to demand better. Yours faithfully, J.P. Loo It is worth emphasising quite how bizarre Litton’s argument here is. Litton has another article, which is available on Ming Pao’s website, which goes further. I intend to respond to it at some point.">

    <p>My <a href="https://www.scmp.com/comment/letters/article/3047787/why-case-against-hong-kongs-emergency-mask-ban-targeting-protesters">letter</a> to the <em>South China Morning Post</em>—</p>
<p>Reasonable disagreement is a fact of life, and Henry Litton (“Why challengers of Hong Kong’s anti-mask law have no case”, 20 Jan) surely has good reasons for his views. But he writes such as as to give the misleading impression that the court had not addressed any of the issues he raises.</p>
<p>Litton writes that, because “the laws on the statute book were scrutinised and some were culled”, those that were not must “remain intact”; since the Emergency Regulations Ordinance was not culled, it must therefore be constitutional.</p>
<p>Yet even the respondents “only rely on this as a factor in favour of validity, and do not submit that the absence of rejection by the NPCSC…preclud[es] any future finding that the ERO contravenes the Basic Law.” Moreover, as noted by the court, article 160 of the Basic Law provides that “[i]f any laws are later discovered to be in contravention of this Law, they shall be amended or cease to have force in accordance with the procedure as prescribed by this Law.”</p>
<p>He then complains that the court paid far too much attention to “cases which had no relevance whatsoever to a proper interpretation of the Basic Law.” Litton says of Henry VIII clauses that the eponymous king “died in 1547.” It is simply puerile to dismiss precedent because it is old. Moreover the court only considered such cases because the defence of the mask law relied on them—and it rejected them, noting that “the LegCo does not enjoy such supremacy in the Diceyan sense.” Would Litton rather that judges ignored what the parties said if they disagreed with it?</p>

<p>It is worth emphasising quite how bizarre Litton’s argument here is. Litton has another <a href="http://video3.mingpao.com/inews/202001/20190108_judge.pdf">article</a>, which is available on <em>Ming Pao</em>’s website, which goes further. I intend to respond to it at some point.</p>
